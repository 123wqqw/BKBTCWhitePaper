# Project Introduction

## A New Era of Digital Finance in the Middle East—The World's First Bitcoin Reserve Bank's Journey to Nasdaq Listing

**Coin-Stock Synergy · Closed-Loop Ecosystem · Cross-Border Financial Revolution**

## Vision and Strategic Positioning

### Who are we?
The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (Dubai) is a cross-regional strategic investment promotion platform established under the leadership of the Saudi government, rooted in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). We are committed to becoming the core hub connecting Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030" with global capital, providing one-stop investment solutions for international enterprises entering the Saudi and Middle Eastern markets through Dubai's geographical and policy advantages.

### Core Mission and Value
- **Promote the third golden asset, BTC, to become the world's securities, GP, LP, and a foundation where capital becomes the core of value management.**
- **Empower global investors**
  - Transform the company itself into an entity with Bitcoin (BTC) as its main reserve asset, and through a series of financial operations, allow investors to indirectly invest in Bitcoin by investing in its corporate stocks or bonds.
- **Build a global non-investment ecosystem**
  - Develop the PayFi platform to empower one-click token issuance for BTC, Swap transactions, BTC reserve strategy, cross-border payments, and RWA resource integration for service providers, opening up a new, fully decentralized world.

## Our Positioning
BANKBTC is the world's first digital bank with Bitcoin reserves as its core asset, committed to becoming the first "Bitcoin concept" innovative enterprise in the Middle East to be listed on Nasdaq. Through an innovative micro-strategy capital operation model, we deeply integrate traditional finance with digital currency, providing secure and efficient Bitcoin asset allocation solutions for Wall Street institutions, GP/LP funds, and global investors.

Our mission is to make Bitcoin a global reserve asset. Through the "Coin-Stock Synergy" model (i.e., the company's stock price grows in synergy with the value of Bitcoin), we aim to promote the inclusion of digital currency into the mainstream financial system and reshape the paradigm of future wealth storage and appreciation.

### The Value Proposition of "Coin-Stock Synergy"
If investors are optimistic about the ***long-term value of Bitcoin*** but do not want to hold it directly, buying ***MSTR stock*** is equivalent to investing in a ***leveraged Bitcoin investment tool***. Because the company has amplified its ability to purchase coins through financing, the rise and fall of its stock price will usually be greater than the rise and fall of Bitcoin itself.

## BKBTC FAQ (To be written by Mr. Wang)

## BKBTC Economics

### Token Supply

- **The total supply of BKBTC tokens will be 21,000,000.**
- **BKBTC Token Supply Distribution**
  - All BKBTC tokens are obtained through a minting lottery.

### Burn Mechanism

- **Transaction Fee Burn**
  - Those who participate in minting and receive corresponding rewards will trigger a transaction fee burn upon withdrawal. The burn rate is 7% of the daily withdrawal amount. **Formula:**
  ```
  Burn Amount = Daily BTC Withdrawal * 7%
  ```
- **GameFi Burn**
  - The GameFi center charges different transaction fees for different game paths. **Example:** The battle royale game charges a 5% transaction fee from participating players every 60 seconds for burning.
- **Ecosystem Burn**
  - A 0.5% transaction fee will be charged for each sale and replacement of chargers and RWA power banks for burning.

### End of Burn

The total supply of BKBTC tokens will remain fixed at **2,100,000 tokens**.

## Technology and Innovation
By adding an extension to the ICP network for a second layer on BTC, the fluidity of BTC has been enhanced.

### Network Integration
By running a Bitcoin adapter, ICP nodes provide canister smart contracts with real-time access to the latest state of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin UTXOs set up on ICP enable canister smart contracts to read the balance of any BTC address.

### Chain-Key Signatures
ICP nodes collaboratively generate threshold ECDSA signatures, enabling smart contracts to sign BTC transactions. Leveraging network integration, these BTC transactions are written directly to the Bitcoin blockchain without any cross-chain bridges. Chain-key signatures can also derive BTC addresses, allowing ICP smart contracts to read, write, and own BTC.

### Chain Fusion and Interoperability
In addition to the Bitcoin adapter, ICP smart contracts can also read and write to other blockchains, providing an unparalleled Web3 interconnected experience. A single smart contract can read, write, and own assets on multiple blockchains through features like network integration, RPC integration, and HTTPS calls.

### Chain-Key Bitcoin
Native Bitcoin transactions require high fees and long waits for block confirmation. ckBTC was created as a 1:1 twin of Bitcoin, designed to leverage the 1-2 second finality and extremely low transaction fees of the ICP ecosystem. ckBTC is one of the first Chain Fusion applications and supports multiple dapps for different use cases.

## Rule Description

### Minting Conditions
- Each mint requires 0.001 BTC and BKBTC equivalent to 5% of the BTC value

### Gameplay
- 2 sessions per day
- **Time Slots**
  - 1st session: 12:00 - 17:00 daily
  - 2nd session: 18:00 - 23:00 daily

### Winning Conditions
- Participation stops at the end time, the prize pool is randomly distributed, 21 participants form a group, and a winner is drawn.
- **Winner:** Receives a 150% monthly BKBTC reward.
- **Non-winners:** The participation amount is returned, a 10% BKBTC fee is consumed, and a 2% BTC reward is given. Daily interest rate of 4%.

### Team Minting Rewards
- Refer 1 person to get rewards from 2 generations, up to a maximum of 20 generations of minting turnover.
- 1st generation: 20%
- 2nd generation: 10%
- 3rd-10th generation: 5%
- 11th-20th generation: 3%
- **Example:** If your team's minting turnover reaches 1.05 million USD worth of BTC, with 50,000 USD winning and 1 million USD not winning, minting once gives 2% which is 20,000 USD. With 20 generations of minting turnover, 20,000 USD / 20 = 1,000 USD. Twice a day is 2,000 USD worth of BTC, which is a monthly income of 60,000 USD in BTC.

## Battle Royale and Wealth Management Pool

### Introduction

#### The wealth management pool is mainly divided into two types:

##### Type One
- **RWA-based Wealth Management - Starting a new track in the Bitcoin ecosystem**
- Stake BKBTC to get BTC, with an annualized interest rate of 10%-160%
- **Investment principal is in BKBTC**
- **Draw date is every 3 days**
- **Choose whether BTC will rise or fall**
- **Annualized rates are 160% and 10%**
- If the chosen price direction matches the settlement price, receive 160% daily BTC.
- If the chosen price direction does not match, receive 10% daily BTC.
- A single account can deposit a maximum of BKBTC equivalent to 1 BTC.

##### Type Two
- **GameFi Wealth Management - Making BKBTC Greater**
- **Non-active investment**
- When a battle royale participant wins, they will receive fragments. When the fragments accumulate to 0.01 BTC in value, it automatically triggers a feedback to the BTC wealth management.
- The BTC wealth management product is passively triggered. When the amount of BKBTC collected reaches the value of 1 BTC, 10% of the total BKBTC value is released to stakers according to a weighted dividend. When a releaser's received amount reaches 0.01 BTC in value, they exit.
- **Accelerate the ecological development of BKBTC**
